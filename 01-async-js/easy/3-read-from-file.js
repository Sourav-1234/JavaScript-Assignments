// ## Reading the contents of a file

// Write code to read contents of a file and print it to the console. 
// You can use the fs library to as a black box, the goal is to understand async tasks. 
// Try to do an expensive operation below the file read and see how it affects the output. 
// Make the expensive operation more and more expensive and see how it affects the output. 

const fs = require("fs");

// Start
console.log("Start reading file");

// Async file read
fs.readFile("sample.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("File content:");
  console.log(data);
});

// Expensive synchronous operation
console.log("Starting expensive operation...");

let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {
  sum += i;
}

console.log("Expensive operation finished");
console.log("Sum:", sum);

// End
console.log("End of program");
